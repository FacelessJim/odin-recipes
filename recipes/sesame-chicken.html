    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Although sesame chicken is a westernized Chinese take-out dish, nobody can say no to these crunchy, nutty little bites of chicken that are covered with a glossy sauce.
        This dish can be pre-prepped in a large batch and assembled with so little effort. You can make the sauce ahead of time. It will last a few weeks or 6 months in the freezer. 
        You just use it as needed. The chicken can be breaded and deep-fried for the first time. It will stay good in the freezer for six months. Take it out of the freezer whenever you want to eat it again. 
        Directly double fry it without defrosting. Of course, the frozen chicken will take a little longer to fry than when it is fresh.</p>
